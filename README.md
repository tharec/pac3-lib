# pac3-lib

## About
The repository contains pac3 outfit files for Garry's Mod. The outfits are mainly used on Star Wars Roleplay servers just to show off or to modify certain characters for my personal liking. Some of the outfits can be easily modified to fit a new character, some may not be.

Addons from the workshop are needed for most of the outfits, but mainly used addons found on the *MVG Imperial* and *Imperium Network Lothal RP* servers with some additional content got from here and there.

## Credit and use of content
If you use any of the pac3 files, add a link to the repository or at least mention me via my Steam name "retech" in the credits.
